### Introduction

TARA Pharma Corp. (TARA), headquartered in Seattle, WA, develops, manufactures and markets a range of dietary supplement product lines. With 4,000 employees and 2 billion USD (FY 2017) in revenue, it must maintain its global brand integrity and continue its financial growth. Doing so depends on attracting and retaining great talent.  Players in the Seattle pharmaceutical industry face stiff competition for new hires, and the fact that it is not uncommon for some local firms to entice away their competitors' current employees makes it even more challenging.

To gain a competitive edge over its rivals, TARA is evaluating the role a data science approach to talent management could play as part of its overall business strategy. TARA's CIO and team have proposed an analytics-centric talent management initiative, which, like all proposals, is subject to a proof-of-concept analysis before it can be presented to the TARA executive managment team for consideration/approval.

TARA's CIO has contracted DDS Analytics to conduct the proof-of-concept analysis as part of evaluating the intiative. The proof-of-concept analysis aims to illustrate how applying data analytics to employee data would provide insight for employee retention and in turn contribute to the justification for investing in the initiative.

TARA management suspects that the attrition rate is too high for its top-performing employees in the Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales departments. Thus far, the feeling has been based on an informal headcount review not formal analysis. DDS Analytics will use a formal Data Science analysis to take the first in-depth look at the its employee data. 

TARA management provided internal employee data for analysis purposes, with two key analysis objectives in mind:

**Analysis Key Objectives for Proof-of-Concept:**

1. Identify at a minimum the top three factors contributing to top-performing employee attrition in the Human Resources, Research and Development, and Sales departments.

2. Identify job role specific trends to better understand employee satisfaction

### Data Source

The data set utilized in the analyses was compiled by Qualtrics as requested by TARA management. Qualtrics conducted employee satisfaction surveys and merged the survey results with TARA personnel records for 2017 Fiscal Year, ensuring it was ultimately stripped of all personal identifiable information (e.g. name, date of birth). The Qualtrics dataset only contains employees whose most recent performance ratings are 3 (Excellent) or 4 (Outstanding) in three departments of its Seattle location: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.

A total of 37 data elements per employee entry were available. The full details of each data element is located in the dataset codebook.

The Qualtrics Survey-Related Ratings information is as follows:  Environment Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Relationship Satisfaction and Work Life Balance.

The TARA Personnel Records-Related information (for FY 2017) can be grouped as follows:

Individual Related:

- Age

- Over 18 (y/n)

### Load Data
```{r load_dataset}
```

### Tidy Data
In summary, tidying the data entailed the following tasks:

(1) Renamed column names in order to shorten them to no more than 12 characters to comply with TARA standard. 

(2) Verified that there was no inidication of missing data.

(3) Converted multiple fields from INT data type to Factors to make it clear that the data represents categories, not continuous numbers.

(4) Addeded descriptive fields that corresponds to numeric ratings, such a "Excellent" for the rating 3, for the following data fields:  

- Education description field is EducDesc

- EnvironmentSatisfaction description field is EnvirSatDesc

- JobInvolvement description field is JobInvlvDesc

- JobSatisfaction description field is JobSatDesc

- RelationshipSatisfaction description field is RlshpSatDesc

- PerformanceRating description field is PerfRtgDesc

- WorkLifeBalance description field is WkLifBalDesc 


For the Education field, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 = 'Below College'
	
	2 = 'College'
	
	3 = 'Bachelor'
	
	4 = 'Master'
	
	5 = 'Doctor'
	
For the EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction and RelationshipSatisfaction fields, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 'Low'
	
	2 'Medium'
	
	3 'High'
	
	4 'Very High'
	
For the PerformanceRating field, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 'Low'
	
	2 'Good'
	
	3 'Excellent'
	
	4 'Outstanding'
	
For the WorkLifeBalance, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:		
  
  1 'Bad'
	
	2 'Good'
	
	3 'Better'
	
	4 'Best'
	
	
Qualtrics had already removed individuals under the age of 18 so there was no need to filter any additional entries.

```


### Attrition Percent Per Department  
Formally determing the FY2017 top-performer percent attrition for the three departments of concern, confirmed TARA's thoughts that the attrition rates seemed higher in these departments.  Ideally, companies aim to keep attrition rates for top-performers as close to 0 as possible.

```{r dept_attrpct}
```


### Preliminary Analysis

While conducting the Exploratory Data Analysis we performed multiple preliminary tests in order to get a better understand of the dataset and attempt to summarize the main characteristics by way of visualizing any possible trends. First and foremost, after receiving and cleaning the dataset an initial analysis concluded there were no observations collected from individuals under the age of 18, which allows us to proceed without requiring parental informed consent forms.

** Main Characteristic **

The dataset was comprised of 35 variables and 1470 observations of which there were no missing observations or outliers we deemed as significant. There were 2 variables that had the same response from all employee thus we did not utilize them for our analysis those variable are Standard Hours and Employee Count. The descriptive statistics table provides the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, range and standard error of nine of the variables. We use these statistics to measure the central tendencies and spreads of the variables we are interested in.  

** Visualizing Characteristic **

To determine if there is a normal distribution we conducted histogram plots on two of the variables: Age and Monthly Income. After visually examining the Monthly Income histogram the distribution right-skewed and not a normal distribution. This could be due to the data that have a lower bound we will proceed without a transformation and run the models with the original data then determine if a transformation is required. The Age Histogram appears to be more normally distributed with a slight right skew. We ran three frequency tables and count of 3 other variables. The frequency tables for Gender, Education and Job Roles indicate: there is a 60/40 split of males to females; almost 70% of those working at TARA hold some form of advanced degree; and over half of the population of interest come from the three Job Roles Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Lab Tech. We determined the management position from the population of interest were those classified as the highest Job Level which came back as falling into two categories, Manager and Research Director, totally 69 individuals.

```{r desc_stat}
```

### Find a suitable model for Attrition based on given data

To determine the initial model,  glm is used. It allows us to give option of defining response variable as binomial, for the given dataset, Attrition is the response variable and has 2 values , TRUE/FALSE. For glm, R converts categorical variables into indicator variables. It does not like spaces in categorical values, so the given dataset is modified first to remove spaces from the categorical variables.

**initial model**
```{r feat_sel_init}
```


AIC statistics for this model is 901.66.

**reduced model**
```{r feat_sel_step}
```

We used stepwise selection method to select the appropriate predictors for Attrition model.default dirction= "both".  AIC statistics for this model is 901.66. Stepwise selection , chose the 10th model @ AIC = 884.0241
This is not the best model but considering our prelimenary analysis, this model should be able to provide us with important predictors. 

*About the stepwise selection method*
step uses add1 and drop1 repeatedly; it will work for any method for which they work, and that is determined by having a valid method for extractAIC. When the additive constant can be chosen so that AIC is equal to Mallows' Cp, this is done and the tables are labelled appropriately.

Above plot has top 10 important factors from our selected Model. We will discuss the top 3 -

1- OVerTime  \
2- StockOptions \
3- Environment Satisfaction \

### Visualize attrition and some of its factors

```{r plot_attr}
```


In the past year we have seen 16% Attrition in this company. Let's analyze some of these factors and see if there is any relation with Attrition.

**OverTime and  Attrition **

Overtime can be positive in that it allows employees the opportunity to make extra money and to make their mark on their workplaces, but it can also be negative in that too much overtime can lead to employee burnout.When employees are overworked, they become less productive and are more inclined to quit their job for other opportunities.


```{r plot_attr_ot}
```

There are 200+ people leaving the company , out of which about 54% did Overtime. The plot showing retention, about 24% employees did overtime.   POints to consider -

-  What is the need for OverTime? Is this requirement concentrated to cetain departments ?
-  Are you compensating your employees enough for the overtime ?

```{r plot_attr_ot_areas}
```

Reviewing different areas within the company, top 2 contenders for OVerTime are Research Scientist and Sales Executive roles. Most of the OVerTime is seen within the Research & Development Department. 


**Stock Options and Attrition **
Traditionally, stock option plans have been used as a way for companies to reward top management and "key" employees and link their interests with those of the company and other shareholders.Stock Option plans may be intended to give all employees stock in the company or to just provide a benefit for some "key" employees

```{r plot_attr_inv}
```

About 65% employees leaving the company have stocl lvl option 0. Majority of retained employees have StockOption lvl 1. Companies can have different plans for stock options and keep top benefits for the key employees but you may want to revise your lvl 0 stock option to get more employees thinking about long term benefits.


```{r corr_attr_inv}
```

One would tend to think Stock Options would be correlated to Job Levels or Years at Firm, but based on our data, there is no correlation between them. There is some correlation between Job Levels and Years at Firm but none with StockOptions.

```{r plot_Attr_invc_areas}
```

Most of the employees have lower stockOptions i.e. 0 and 1 .Most of the employees are within the 10 years at firm and still have options 0 and 1 only. It is posssible higher stock options maybe only for key employees , but looking at the attrition pattern within employees having stock Option 0 is not enough to retain them.  Maybe it is time to revise these options to make them attractive for employees.


**Environment Satisfaction and Attrition **

Many businesses fail to understand the importance of working environment for employee . Employee us an essential component in the process of achieving the mission and vision of business. To meet the standards of organization, employees need a working environment that allows them to work freely without problems that may restrain them from performing upto the level of their full potential.Work environment consists of employees safety, job security, relations with co-workers, work recognition , motivation for performing well  among many others.

```{r plot_attr_env}
```

About 30% of the employees leaving the company  show low environment satisfaction.Close to 50% people leaving the company had high environment satisfaction but there could be other factors leading them to seek other oportunities  . 

Skip level meetings are a suggested way to get feedback about immediate supervisors . Periodic performance appreciations and team building activities are a good way to boost a positive work environment.


### Data Visualization 

In visualizing the data, specific variables are examined to determine other relationships that may exist. The first variables to be examined are Age and Income. Income was chosen to be represented by Monthly Income over the other rate options. The bar plot provides one visualization of the total monthly income for each age of employees in the company by gender. 

Based on the plot, for the majority of age groups, males as a total are compensated a higher amount than females as a total. That is something for TARA to consider and potentially be concerned about when looking at attrition, as equal pay is very important for females when looking at career opportunities. The trend of the graph highlights that individuals in the middle of their career tend to make the most money, while newer and very seasoned employees see a smaller income. It is important for TARA to consider income in an appeal to the newer and seasoned population, to retain great minds and the future leaders. 
 
The scatterplot is a second visualization of the same data. Based on the fit line, it is clear there is a positive relationship between age and monthly income, having a trend of income increasing with age. However, as age increases, it is also visible that the range of income grows. This plot supports the older employees having a larger income, however, based on the bar plot representation, that may not necessarily be the case. TARA may benefit from evaluating their financial compensation among employees to make sure it is appropriate and reflective of value added to the company. 

```{r age_inc_analysis}
```

The second visualization focuses on understanding the factors that directly influence overall work-life satisfaction. DDS Analytics determined the following variables are the most important in determining work-life satisfaction: work-life balance, environment satisfaction, job involvement, job satisfaction, performance rating, and work-relationship satisfaction. All of these play a role in an employee’s motivation, accountability, and overall attitude towards working. Employers often focus on the work at hand, forgetting the employee and the hard work required every day. 

Histograms were chosen to represent the ratings and percentage of employees that put themselves in each category. Although there are many positive ratings, it is important to note the presence of negative ratings. As Environment Satisfaction was modeled with attrition earlier, TARA might choose to have the same modeling performed on Job and Relationship Satisfaction to gain a deeper understanding of attrition.

Averages were calculated for each factor based on rating, and the averages across the categories hover around a 2.7. That number represents more than just “Medium/Good”, but less than “High/Excellent/Better”. Although the averages are on the positive side, TARA needs to look at what programs and resources can be implemented to shift the average towards “Very High/Outstanding/Best”. This could involve things such as greater recognition for work, open communication with management, and more transparency in communication and planning. The company needs to raise overall work-life satisfaction, as seen above, environment satisfaction was deemed one of the top three factors for attrition.
