The data set utilized in the analyses was compiled by Qualtrics as requested by TARA management. Qualtrics conducted employee satisfaction surveys and merged the survey results with TARA personnel records for 2017 Fiscal Year, ensuring it was ultimately stripped of all personal identifiable information (e.g. name, date of birth). The Qualtrics dataset only contains employees whose most recent performance ratings are 3 (Excellent) or 4 (Outstanding) in three departments of its Seattle location: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.
