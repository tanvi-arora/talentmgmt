The data set utilized in the analyses was compiled by Qualtrics as requested by TARA management. Qualtrics conducted employee satisfaction surveys and merged the survey results with TARA personnel records for 2017 Fiscal Year, ensuring it was ultimately stripped of all personal identifiable information (e.g. name, date of birth). The Qualtrics dataset only contains employees whose most recent performance ratings are 3 (Excellent) or 4 (Outstanding) in three departments of its Seattle location: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.

**source dataset Field Descriptions :** 
A total of 37 data elements per employee entry were available. 

The Qualtrics Survey-Related Ratings information is as follows:  

- Environment Satisfaction   
- Job Satisfaction            
- Job Involvement
- Relationship Satisfaction
- Work Life Balance

For the Education field , the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 = 'Below College'
	
	2 = 'College'
	
	3 = 'Bachelor'
	
	4 = 'Master'
	
	5 = 'Doctor'
	
For the EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction and RelationshipSatisfaction fields, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 'Low'
	
	2 'Medium'
	
	3 'High'

For the PerformanceRating field, the corresponding descriptions are as follows:	
  
  1 'Low'

Qualtrics had already removed individuals under the age of 18 so there was no need to filter any additional entries.
